# HTML Fund Me

A minimalistic web application for funding a smart contract using MetaMask.

## Requirements

- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) - Browser extension for blockchain interaction.

## Quickstart

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (or use a local server for better experience).

2. Click "Connect" to link your MetaMask wallet.

3. Enter an amount and click "Fund" to send ETH to the contract.

## Setup for Transactions

To test transactions, deploy a FundMe contract on a local blockchain (e.g., using Foundry or Hardhat) and update `constants.js` with the contract address.
